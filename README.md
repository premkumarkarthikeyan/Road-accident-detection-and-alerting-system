## Road Accident Detection and Alerting System

## About
Road accidents are a critical global safety issue. Real-time detection of accidents can significantly reduce response times, potentially saving lives. Advanced systems may analyze surrounding traffic conditions and environmental factors to assess risk levels and prioritize responses accordingly. Once an incident is detected and analyzed, the system communicates with emergency services, nearby vehicles, or traffic management centers to coordinate an effective response. This alerting process may include precise GPS coordinates and accident details, enabling emergency responders to reach the accident site quickly and efficiently.

## Features
 - Video/image data analysis for accident detection.
 - Real-time alert system integrated with emergency services.
 - Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., CNN for object detection).
 - Testing with real-time data or pre-recorded accident scenarios.
## Requirements
Hardware: GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GTX/RTX series) for accelerated training. Sufficient RAM (16 GB or more recommended). Software: Python (3.6 or later) Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux Dataset: A labeled dataset of liver images with annotated tumor regions (e.g., LiTS dataset).
